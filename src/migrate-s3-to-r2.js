/**
 * One-off CLI: migrate every object in the source S3-compatible bucket
 * (S3_* env vars -- see .env.example) into R2, deleting each object from the
 * source once it is confirmed safely in R2. Streams straight through; never
 * writes a video to disk.
 *
 *   node src/migrate-s3-to-r2.js                        # dry run (default, nothing changes)
 *   node src/migrate-s3-to-r2.js --apply                # migrate + delete from source
 *   node src/migrate-s3-to-r2.js --apply --keep-source   # migrate, keep source objects
 *   node src/migrate-s3-to-r2.js --prefix episodes/      # limit to one prefix
 *   node src/migrate-s3-to-r2.js --apply --concurrency 4
 *
 * Safe to re-run: objects already in R2 with a matching size are skipped, so
 * an interrupted run (or a retry after --apply reports failures) just picks
 * up where it left off.
