/**
 * One-time migration: streams every object from the source S3-compatible
 * bucket (S3_* env vars, see s3source.js) straight into R2, then deletes it
 * from the source once the copy in R2 is confirmed. Each object's bytes pass
 * through this process exactly once -- GetObject's body is piped directly
 * into R2's multipart Upload, so nothing is ever staged on disk or held
 * whole in memory, no matter how large the video is.
 *
 * Safe to re-run: an object already present in R2 with a matching size is
 * skipped (and still deleted from the source if deleteSource is set), so an
 * interrupted run just picks up where it left off.
