/**
 * Honors Telegram's own rate limit instead of giving up on it.
 *
 * FLOOD_WAIT is not a bug and not something any client library can bypass --
 * it is Telegram's server telling this account "wait exactly N seconds before
 * calling this method again." Every Telegram client, official app included,
 * is bound by the same rule. Treating it as a normal failure (mark the item
 * failed, move on) is what makes downloads or forwards look incomplete when
 * really they just needed to wait.
 *
 * This waits out the reported time and retries, up to a generous cap, so a
 * download or forward that hits a flood wait finishes on its own instead of
 * requiring a manual retry.
